## üöÄ Project Goals

- Build a scalable and maintainable full-stack web application.
- Practice team collaboration and real-world software development workflows.
- Implement authentication, booking, and search features.
- Use secure and modern APIs.
- Follow agile methodology and CI/CD practices.

## üß© Database Design

### Entities and Fields:

#### Users
- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `password`
- `is_host`

#### Properties
- `id`
- `title`
- `location`
- `price`
- `host_id` (foreign key to Users)

#### Bookings
- `id`
- `user_id`
- `property_id`
- `check_in`
- `check_out`

#### Reviews
- `id`
- `user_id`
- `property_id`
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### Payments
- `id`
- `booking_id`
- `amount`
- `status`

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **user** can make multiple **bookings**.
- A **property** can have multiple **reviews**.
- A **booking** is linked to a **payment**.

## üß∞ Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profile. Hosts can list their properties and manage bookings.

### Property Management
Hosts can list, update, and delete their properties. Each property includes details such as title, description, images, price, and location.

### Booking System
Users can check availability and book properties for specific dates. Hosts receive booking notifications.

### Review System
Users can leave reviews for properties they‚Äôve stayed in. Reviews include star ratings and comments.

### Search and Filter
Allows users to search for properties based on location, date range, price, and more.

### Payment Integration
Securely handles payment processing through a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).

---

## üîê API Security

### Authentication
Only registered users can access protected endpoints. Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) will be used.

### Authorization
Role-based access control ensures only hosts can list properties and only users who booked can leave reviews.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting the number of requests per IP/user.

### Input Validation
All user inputs will be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data consistency.

### Importance
- **Protect user data** (emails, passwords).
- **Secure transactions** (payment data).
- **Prevent abuse** of the platform (bot activity, spamming).

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the software development process ‚Äî code is tested, integrated, and deployed automatically with every update.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For running automated tests and builds.
- **Docker**: For building consistent containers across dev, staging, and production.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS**: Deployment platforms for the live app.

### Why It‚Äôs Important
- Ensures faster, more reliable deployments.
- Reduces human error during deployment.
- Improves team productivity and confidence in code changes.
